Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000 records
Using the code below, SQL will display the total number of entries at the bottom of the query result. The COUNT() function can also be used, however such a function
ignores null values and thus may be inaccurate if the data is incomplete. The method used below allows the user to get a view of the type of data in each table as a bonus.
"
SELECT *
FROM attribute
"
ii. Business table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

iii. Category table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

iv. Checkin table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

v. elite_years table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

vi. friend table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

vii. hours table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

viii. photo table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

ix. review table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

x. tip table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.

xi. user table = 10,000 records
Similarly to (i.), see explanation.
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000 records
The primary key for the business table is the column called "id". In it, the system will assign a unique identifier to each table entry. The number of distinct records will
correspond to this id value. 
"
SELECT DISTINCT(id)
FROM business
"
In this code, I used the distinct function to find the number of distinct businesses. Each business should have a unique id.

ii. Hours = 1,562 records
Using the foreign key of business_id, and the distinct function, you arrive at this number. There are 1562 distinct businesses with 1 or more hours detailed in the table. This means not all 10,000 businesses have a record of
their hours. 
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id)
FROM hours
"

If you can also determine the overall "unique" entries by also selecting the hours table. 
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id), hours
FROM hours

RESULT: 10,000 records
"
This will show all the distinct entries for business_id and hours. Since every business can have more than one set of operating hours.

iii. Category = 2,643 records
Using the foreign key of business_id again, you find that there are 2,643 businesses with one or more category assigned to them. Meaning roughly 26% of all businesses in the data base are categorized.
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id)
FROM category
"

If you can also determine the overall "unique" entries by also selecting the hours table. 
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id), category
FROM category

RESULT: 10,000 records
"
This will show you all non-repeated entries (overall unique entries.)

iv. Attribute = 1,115 records
Using the foreign key, business id we can determine that there are 1,115 unique businesses that have one attribute or more assigned to them. This means most businesses in the database
do not have an attribute assigned.
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id)
FROM attribute
"

Specifying that we also want to see all distinct attributes for all distinct businesses we observe that there are no repeat entries:
"
SELECT DISTINCT(business_id), name
FROM attribute

RESULT: 10,000 records
"

v. Review = 10,000 unique reviews for 8,090 unique businesses from 8,581 unique users.
The table has the primary key "id" and the foreign keys "business_id" and "user_id"sing a similar select statement to the one below, we can find all distinct businesses represented in the table 8,090. A similar query can be used to find all
unique reviews and users. This data means that, of the 10,000 businesses in the database, 8,090 have been reviewed. Each review is unique.
"
SELECT DISTICT(business_id)
FROM review
"

vi. Checkin = 493 records
Using the foreign key, business_id, there are 493 unique businesses that have a check-in record.

vii. Photo = 10,000 unique photos from 6,493 unique businesses. 
Using primary key, photos, we find that all photos in the table are unique. These fotos correspond to 6,493/10,00 businesses in the database (using business_id foreign key).

viii. Tip = 537 unique users with tips for 3979 unique businesses. 
Using the foreign keys user_id and business_id in the tip table, you can identify that the data includes these unique records. 

ix. User = 10,000 users
Using the primary key "id" for the user table, we find that the database has 10,000 distinct entries for users

x. Friend = 11 distinct users with 9415 associated friends.
Using the foreign key user_id, we may find which users have associated friends.

xi. Elite_years = 2,780 users with elite years
2,780 users are part of the elite table when classified with the foreign key user_id.

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	-- count the numer of ids in the specified table
	SELECT COUNT(id)
	From user
	-- creates a table WHERE only null values exists by using OR to link various IS NULL statements
	WHERE name IS NULL 
	OR review_count IS NULL 
	OR yelping_since IS NULL 
	-- the columns below are made of numerical values, note the product of a number and a NULL is NULL. Therefore, the product of the columns specified turns out to be NULL if any of the columns is NULL
	OR  useful*funny*cool*fans*average_stars IS NULL
	OR compliment_hot*compliment_more*compliment_profile*compliment_cute*compliment_list*compliment_note*compliment_plain*compliment_cool*compliment_funny*compliment_writer*compliment_photos IS NULL

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 
-- selected the city and summed the review count where the table is grouped by city. This yields the tot number of reviews per city. 
	SELECT city, SUM(review_count) AS totReviews
	FROM business
-- grouping by city is crucial because it will try to filter all the data by city allowing the query to sum all the review counts per each city
	GROUP BY city
-- the number of reviews was named "totReviews" in the select statement now we order it by descending order.
	ORDER BY totReviews DESC
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+-----------------+------------+
	| city            | totReviews |
	+-----------------+------------+
	| Las Vegas       |      82854 |

6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

i. Avon

SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	-- select the stars while counting the number of entries for each star rating
	SELECT stars, COUNT(id) AS countStars
	FROM business
	-- query only entries corresponding to the city Avon
	WHERE city = 'Avon'
	-- group by stars to show the number of businesses with that star rating
	GROUP BY stars
	-- order for neatness sake
	ORDER BY stars ASC

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú star rating and count):
